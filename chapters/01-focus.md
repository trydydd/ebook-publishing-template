# What to Actually Focus On
When you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed in Jiu-Jitsu, the first thing to ask is not “Why am I not getting better?” It's “What am I actually trying to get better at?” This chapter is about reconnecting with what matters most in your training and letting go of the stuff that quietly eats your joy.

## Fun, Impact, and Consistency
Belts are cool. No doubt about it (a black belt somewhere just rolled their eyes). But if you train long enough, you will realize they are also kind of arbitrary. Some people get promoted for showing up. Others for smashing. Some for vibes. If you are relying on external milestones to validate your training, you will eventually feel frustrated or like you're wasting your time.

Instead, orient your focus toward what you can feel and control:

* Did I move with intention today?
* Did I experience a moment of genuine problem-solving or play?
* Did I learn something interesting about how my body or my partner’s body works?
* Did I consistently meet my goals for the past day/week/month/year?
 
This shift helps you train in a way that is alive, sustainable, and rewarding.

## Fun > Control > Submission
The submission is like the punctuation at the end of a sentence. If the sentence is messy or makes no sense, the punctuation does not really matter. And if you do not enjoy the book, you will never even get to that sentence. Your training has to be fun and meaningful enough to keep you turning the page.

Try reordering your mental priorities:

1. **Enjoyment** – Can I explore this position in a way that feels playful or interesting?
2. **Control** – Can I maintain the position I earned?
3. **Pressure** – Can I make them want out?
4. **Submission** – Can I finish cleanly, slowly, and with awareness?

This mindset builds enjoyment, patience, and problem-solving. It also protects your body and your training partners by reducing frantic, forced submission attempts.

Tap before it hurts. That is not quitting. That is playing the long game. If you collect injuries trying to prove a point, you are just building a highlight reel for your physical therapist. If you are stuck in a position and have no idea what to do, tap and treat it as a reset, not a failure.

## Measuring Training Quality 
It's easy to reduce training to “Did I win the round?” But that question is a trap. It prioritizes ego over progress and reinforces avoidance of difficulty. Instead, measure your sessions using better metrics:

- Did I attempt something new?
- Did I work patiently without rushing?
- Did I solve one small problem more efficiently than last week?
- Did I encounter any new problems?

These questions help you build emotional resilience and shift your mindset toward growth. As you train, pay attention to how you talk to yourself. The voice in your head is an omnipresent coach. Make sure it's one that encourages curiosity and effort instead of tearing you down.

## Organizing Your Training 
Some gyms have detailed curriculums. Others feel like a buffet of whatever the instructor felt like teaching that day. If you are in the latter or just want to sharpen your focus, take control of your own learning.

Start by thinking in terms of **situational categories**:

- **Standing** – All things takedowns, grip fighting, and movement on your feet.
- **Guard** – Retention, passing, recovery, sweeps, and submissions.
- **Pinning** – Top control, escapes, and positional dominance

Pick one of these themes and make it your personal focus for the week. This might look like:

- Asking your training partners to start in mount in open rounds.
- Asking your training partners to work to pass your guard, and resetting if they manage to pin you to the mat.
- Asking your training partners to start standing, and reset after someone scores a takedown.

Then, apply that focus in open rounds even if it's just the last 10 minutes of class. Tiny amounts of targeted effort repeated weekly will reshape your entire game.

**Try This:** Choose one of the three big themes: Standing, Guard, or Pinning. Write it in your training journal. For one week, orient all your open rounds around exploring that area. Treat it like a lab, not a test.

If you are always the one getting smashed under side control, it can start to wear on you. One helpful strategy is to occasionally ask your more experienced training partners to start in the disadvantaged position instead. Let them begin under mount, in your guard, or in a bad pin. Watching how they solve the same problems you struggle with can be both educational and confidence-building. It also evens out the emotional experience of training.
