# Setting Goals

Most BJJ goals suck. They are either too vague, too outcome-focused, or just someone else’s idea of what matters. This chapter is about building goals that actually feel like they belong to you. Ones that spark action, guide your training, and help build a more useful voice in your head.

### Start With Why (Not What)

Before setting any goal, pause and ask why you are training at all. Be honest. Do you want to feel safer? Compete? Move better? Blow off steam after work? 

If your goals don’t match your reason for showing up, they will always feel like a chore. If your goals *do* match, they become fuel.

Here are some common things people want from BJJ:

- Physical competence
- Stress relief
- Challenge
- Confidence
- A social outlet
- A sense of progression

Figure out which of these speak to you. Now shape your goals around that.

### Process Beats Outcome

Outcome goals are about results you do not fully control. Winning a round. Getting a stripe. Tapping someone. These feel good when they happen, but they can’t be the core of your plan. 

Process goals are about the choices you can make. Show up three times this week. Try to off-balance everyone you roll with. Frame early every time you are in bottom side. 

Process goals give you something to aim for today. They also help you build the voice in your head. If your goals are built on outcomes, your inner voice becomes a critic. If your goals are based on effort and attention, your inner voice becomes a coach.

And when things get hard (which they will), that coach is the one who will get you through it.

### Use the “Minimum Effective Dose”

Most people set goals that require a complete lifestyle overhaul. Those goals last about three days.

Instead, try this: set a goal that feels laughably small. Show up twice this week. Watch one technique video. Write down one insight after training. 

These are your seeds. If you plant and water them, they grow. If you try to plant a whole forest at once, it dies.

### Combine Mat and Anywhere Goals

One way to make your goals stick is to include both gym-based goals and portable ones. Instead of saying “Train four times this week,” try “Train or study Jiu-Jitsu at least four times this week.” That way, even if life gets in the way, you can still move forward by watching footage, taking notes, or drilling at home.

Think of it like this:
- Gym-based goals = “Do this on the mat”
- Portable goals = “Do this anywhere, anytime”

When combined, they create momentum no matter what your schedule looks like.

### Goals by Intention

Let’s break down some examples based on *why* you train.

**If you train for self-defense:**

- Start every round this week in a bad position and practice escaping to your feet safely in preparation for disengaging.
- Practice breaking grips and disengaging from standing tie-ups during warmups or drills
- In every round, aim to create and control space before thinking about submissions

**If you train to compete:**

- Choose one takedown and try to enter into it at least once every round
- Practice recovery breathing between rounds to improve your ability to reset under pressure
- Get in at least one round per session with a partner who is actively preparing for competition

**If you train as a hobbyist:**

- Choose one situation and try at least one new idea each round
- At the end of each training session, make a point to thank or compliment one training partner for something specific they did well
- Pick one area of your game that usually feels confusing or chaotic and make it your focus for exploration the next week.

If your training environment does not support your goals, even the best plan will start to feel like a grind. Take a step back and ask: Does this gym offer what I need? Are the classes structured in a way that aligns with how I want to grow? If not, it may be time to talk to your coach, seek out supplemental training, or look for a space that fits better.

**Try This:** Choose one small process goal for your next week of training. Write it down. Make it easy to succeed at. Then do it. Track what it changes, not just in your Jiu-Jitsu, but in your mindset.
