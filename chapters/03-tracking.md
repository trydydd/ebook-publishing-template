# Tracking Progress

### Stop Asking “Am I Better?”

This is the wrong question. It leads to frustration, comparison, and burnout. A better question is, “How am I different from last week?”

Try asking:

- What problems feel less confusing than they used to?
- What patterns am I starting to notice in myself or my opponents?
- What did I try today that I would have avoided a month ago?

Progress is often subtle. It hides in small decisions, and is easy to miss.

### Keep It Low Friction

The best tracking system is one you will actually use. No fancy $50 journal or specifically formatted paper required. Check out my preferred journal template below!

**Journal Template:**

- What do I want to work on today? (complete this one before class!)
- What went well?
- What went poorly?
- Focus for next session?
- Session highlight?
- Mood check: red, yellow, or green?

That’s it. Quick. Honest. Repeatable.

### Watch Footage Like a Coach

When reviewing video, pretend you are coaching a friend. Look for:

- Decision quality
- Timing and reactions
- Positional awareness

Then take one insight and turn it into a drill, game, or focus point. Footage should inform your curiosity, not fuel your self-judgment. If you find yourself struggling here ask a coach that you like to explain how they review footage for students.

**Try This:** Watch one roll and make a compliment sandwich for yourself. Start with one thing you did well, then move on to one area for improvement, and then finish the sandwich with one last thing that you did well.

### Using Tech

Devices like the Morpheus heart rate monitor and Whoop strap can give helpful insights into recovery, strain, and sleep. But these tools are only as useful as the decisions they help you make.

If you use them, let the data serve your goals, not rule your life. Feeling bad because your readiness score dipped might mean you are too focused on the numbers. Use the tools to notice trends, not as an excuse to feel like a failure.

**Try this:** Check in weekly, not obsessively. Look for patterns over time, and use them to make small, intentional changes. If it starts to feel like homework, scale back.
