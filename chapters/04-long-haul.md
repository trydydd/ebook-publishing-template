# Training for the Long Haul

Jiu-Jitsu is fun, but it's also brutal. The longer you train, the more your success depends on your ability to stay healthy, motivated, and emotionally connected to the process. This chapter is not about doing extra work just to grind harder. It's about building a system that lets you train for years without burning out, falling apart, or forgetting why you started.

### What Actually Matters

Yes, strength and conditioning can help. So can stretching. But nothing matters more than showing up, staying healthy, and having fun. Build around those priorities first. Everything else is optional, and only valuable if it supports your ability to enjoy training and stick with it long term.

### Start With Zone 2 Cardio

If you are new to BJJ or just returning and not doing any cardio, Zone 2 is the easiest win. It improves your recovery, endurance, and overall well-being without crushing your body. It also helps you keep training on days where you're too sore or tired to roll.

**Beginner Plan:**

* Choose a modality: walk, ruck, bike, row
* 30 to 45 minutes, 2 to 3 times a week
* Keep it easy enough to talk normally and hold a conversation while moving

Zone 2 makes everything else easier. 

### Avoid the Burnout Trap

Sometimes extra training is good. Other times, it's just you trying to outrun your anxiety. Know the difference. If your mood, sleep, or motivation start to crash, take a step back and reevaluate.

Use this weekly check-in:

* Am I recovering well?
* Am I excited to train?
* Is my body holding up?

Consistency builds skill. Burnout kills it. The goal is not to do more. The goal is to do what works and keep showing up over and over again.

Rolling alone will not build the foundation you need.  It will not build your conditioning holistically. Supplement your training with targeted skill work and aerobic base-building if you want to keep improving and avoid the injury-recovery-repeat cycle.
