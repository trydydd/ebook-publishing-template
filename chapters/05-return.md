# How to Come Back
Whether you quit last month or last year, or you’re recovering from injury, coming back can feel awkward, frustrating, and even a little scary. This chapter will help you rebuild your training rhythm, reset your expectations, and reconnect with the parts of Jiu-Jitsu that made you love it in the first place.

### Start With Why (Again)

Your reason for training might not be the same as it was before you left. That’s okay. Spend some time asking yourself what you actually want out of training now. Are you here to get moving again? To feel strong? To reconnect with your friends? Knowing your why helps guide the rest.

### Set Your Minimums

Instead of jumping back in full steam, try setting a Minimum Effective Dose. What’s the least amount of training that still feels good and meaningful?

* Show up once or twice a week
* Skip the live rounds or more intense battles
* Only roll with partners you trust
* Set boundaries around intensity and recovery

Success here is not about volume. It’s about building momentum without burning out. Set those wins as small as you need to in the beginning, and use that momentum to rebuild your practice. 

### Reset Your Expectations

Your timing might be off. Your cardio might suck. You might feel like a beginner again. That is normal. Remind yourself: you are not starting over. You are starting differently. Focus on process, not performance. It's not exactly like riding a bicycle, but you will make it back.

### Rebuild Your Process Goals

Now’s a great time to revisit Chapter 2. Pick one process goal that supports your comeback. It might be:

* “Stay calm in bad positions for one full round.”
* “Train or study Jiu-Jitsu three times this week.”
* “Write one thing I enjoyed after each session.”

Use these to guide your mindset. They’ll help you build a positive voice in your head again.

### Use Your Journal

Use the Chapter 3 template to track:

* What went well
* What was hard
* What you want to explore next
* Your session highlight
* And how you feel about training (red/yellow/green)

This simple habit can help you reflect honestly without getting overwhelmed by expectations.

### Honor the Fear

It's completely normal to feel nervous, awkward, or unsure. You may fear re-injury, judgment, or just being bad. That’s okay. Take small steps. Train with trusted partners. Stay in control of your pace. Courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s showing up anyway.

### Reconnect With What Feels Good

Pick one position, movement, or idea that brings you joy or interest. Build your comeback around that. It might be a certain guard, pin, or a more broad concept.

**Try This:** For your first week back, treat one comfortable position like home base. Return to it whenever you reset.

### Rebuild Your Support

You do not have to do this alone. Train with people who make it fun. Tell a coach or partner what you’re working on. Surround yourself with folks who celebrate effort and not just performance.

Coming back is not about reclaiming your past. It’s about rebuilding a version of your training that fits *now*. Welcome back.
